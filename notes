Web socket is a two way connection between the server and the client.
Whenever server encounters any update it forward it without any 
request to the client(an example of http long polling in which the http connection b/w
the client and the server is kept open until the client disconnects) and similar from the client side.

You dont have to make frequent requests to the server as in 
http if you use socket programming.

when a web socket connection is established the server responds when new data is available or a timeout is reached. The client then sends a new request(or emits event) to the server(and the server receives the event), and the cycle repeats.
